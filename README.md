Algorithmic Trading Python scripts  
There are several financial algorithms for predicting market movements and buying and selling stocks to make max profits within those periods.I go through such financial research and build the algorithm in python using Quantopian IDE which uses frameworks such as numpy,pandas,scipy to run alogs in zipline backtester.


These are some open source trade algos that are basic and can be easily understood.There are few proprietary coodes that have been written by me.In Case you need to touchbase with me to know more about them.Kindly mail me chirag.matkar@gmail.com
